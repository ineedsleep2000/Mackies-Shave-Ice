          <p>
            We started out as students at Flatiron Schools, Software Engineering
            Program, but now since making this app, we have achieved new heights
            to our coding knowledge.

          <h1>Our Goals</h1>
          <p>
            Our goal is to make a good grade for our Phase-4 Final Code Project
            at Flatiron Schools.

            If you want to support us in our endeavors to make more apps like
            this and succeed in completing phase-4 at Flatiron Schools, be sure
            to send positive energy to our instructor, to influence him to give
            us a good grade on this app!
